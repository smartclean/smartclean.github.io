# Indoor air quality monitoring
SmartClean's air quality measurement sensor is a battery operated sensor that measures the following environmental parameters:

- Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), Temperature, Humidity: The IAQ index, temperature and relative humidity is derived from the measurements by *Bosch BME680* module.
A detailed note on its functionality and measurement parameters can be found [here](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/datasheets/bst-bme680-ds001.pdf) and [here](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/media/boschsensortec/downloads/application_notes_1/bst-bme680-an014.pdf).

- Ammonia (ppb): This metric is measured using an electrochemical sensing module from *Semiatech*. Values are measured in units of parts per billion.

## Datasheet
The datasheet for the sensor can be found [here](https://www.smartclean.io/matrix/pdfs/DATASHEET_AQ-BT-2109.pdf).
