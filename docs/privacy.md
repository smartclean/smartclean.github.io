# Privacy policies

Privacy and Security
{: .label .label-green }

Your Privacy is important and so is the security of our systems.

We have some mechanisms in place to protect your data, and our systems from unauthorised access.

1. [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/iam.html) is for admins to view, manage, audit, and control access to users.
2. Jump to the [Roles subpage of IAM](/iamRoles.html) to learn about pre-defined Roles in our platform and their access. 
3. Jump to our [Data Policies](/data_policies.html) page to understand how your data is governed in our platform.
4. Wipe-out: Removal of all data related to your account on request.
